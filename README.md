# MiniProject2_TeamFrontRow

Here is majed code, and moreover, I put some questions I have
Questions: 
1. When I made my branch I took everything inside the master, but what happens when I pull from my branch( do we have to pull from 
branch or Master?) if I pull from my branch then I DO SOME change on my code then push it to my branch, then we do merge, Do we gonna
have conflict if the others do the same ? 


Thinking of changing the name of method login() to setConnection ? Also what about having this method and other methods which 
we might need to user inside an individual class( name it Tools ) ? 

or what do u think man?
